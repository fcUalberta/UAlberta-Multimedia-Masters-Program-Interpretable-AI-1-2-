This repository contains source code for Part 1 & 2 of our project which is based on improving Activation based techniques

Part 1:
- New implementation of Grad-CAM Grad-CAM++ & Smooth Grad-CAM++ in VGG16
- Extending the above techniques for Xception & InceptionV3

Part 2: 
- Novel Combination of Integrated Gradients and CAM techniques on VGG16

Hardware requirements:
- 25GB RAM
- 1080 GPU (if available)
P.S: I have exported the complete folder to Google drive and ran from Google Colab with 25GB RAM, no GPU

Software requirements:
Refer requirements.txt file

Results:

Part 1 : Visualization of Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM ++ and Smooth Grad-CAM++ in VGG16
